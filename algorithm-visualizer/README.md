# Algorithm Visualizer

The Alogrithm Visualizer is a web-based tool that allows users to interactively visualize various algorithms. This project provides a hands-on learning experience by allowing users to see how algorithms works in real-time. Whether you're a student learning or a developer looking to understand complex algorithms, this tool can help you gain a deeper insight.

**Please note**: This project is currently under development. Your feedback and contributions are welcome as we continue to develop the visualizer.

## Features

-   **Algorithm Selection**: Choose from a variety of algorithms, including sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, and more.
-   **Interactive Visualization**: Watch the algorithms step through its process in real-time and understand its inner workings.
-   **Customizable Inputs**: Adjust input parameters to see how the algorithm behaves with different data sets.
-   **User-friendly Interface**: Intutive and easy to use interface for both beginner and experienced developers.
-   **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes, including desktop and mobile devices.
